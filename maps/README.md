# Maps

Each directory here is a map pack, containing a bundle of .MIS / .DSC files (and possibly .TED / .VOLs if the map has custom assets).
To install a map pack, copy the _contents_ (not the directory itself) into the `base/missions` directory of a standard Tribes install
(in the end, the .MIS, etc. file should be in `base/missions` and not under a directory).

Some map packs may require certain mods or other setup. If so, the map pack will contain a `README.md` explaining the requirements.

## Layout

Organize your maps into map packs as you see fit.

If your map pack has any special requirements (anything beyond "copy to `base/missions`),
include a `README.md`.
