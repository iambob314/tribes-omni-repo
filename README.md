# Starsiege: Tribes omnibus developer repo

This repo aims to be a one-stop shop for all content created by Tribes modders, scripters, modelers, etc.!

Join the remnant Tribes dev community on Discord: https://discord.gg/cZAsGx5c

## Layout

Each directory holds a different kind of content:
* `assets`: models, textures, sounds, etc.
* `clientscripts`: client-side scripts, such as ski scripts, RPG helper scripts like Deus, etc.
* `mods`: full Tribes mods (most are git submodules, which cross-link to other repos)
* `plugins`: mem.dll plugins (adding new functionality and fixes to Tribes.exe itself)
* `tools`: developer tools for modding and modeling, such as VOL extractors, texture converters, etc.
* `misc`: anything else that doesn't fit above

See README.md in each directory for more info.
